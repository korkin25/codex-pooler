defmodule CodexPooler.Upstreams.SavedResets.PostResetEvidence do
  @moduledoc """
  Decides whether fresh provider quota evidence confirms, reblocks, or leaves
  pending a redemption that already consumed a credit.

  This is the evidence gate for the self-healing convergence: a consumed reset
  stays `consumed_pending_probe` until the provider supplies *fresh, explicitly
  covered, parse-safe account evidence observed at or after the consume time*.

    * `:confirmed` — a fresh post-consume account window is usable; the identity
      recovered and normal evidence-based routing resumes.
    * `:reblocked` — a fresh post-consume account window is genuinely exhausted;
      the reset did not clear the block.
    * `:pending` — no qualifying fresh account evidence (the provider omitted or
      nulled the account window, or only stale/inferred evidence exists). Nothing
      transitions; the old exhausted row is preserved untouched.

  Because an omitted account descriptor leaves the previously stored window with
  its *old* `observed_at`, the `observed_at >= consumed_at` filter alone keeps
  that stale evidence from confirming — no fabricated quota, fail-closed.

  Classification evaluates the canonical effective window view
  (`Windows.effective_quota_windows/2`), the same fold routing reads: obsolete
  rows from a different source describing the same logical window cannot veto a
  newer usable observation, while genuinely distinct current account windows
  keep their fail-closed routing semantics. Only the *temporal* filter runs
  before the fold — a still-fresh pre-consume row can never win the
  logical-window ranking and eclipse the post-consume evidence it would then
  be filtered away from — while the account and parse-safety checks run after
  it, so the fold ranks exactly the rows routing ranks and an unparseable
  winner fails closed instead of being folded away.

  Pure: it never touches the repo and reuses the routing window classifiers so
  "usable" and "exhausted" mean exactly what routing means.
